# brightness.ahk

This is a simple script that allows you to adjust the brightness of your screen using keyboard shortcuts. It uses AutoHotkey, a free and open-source scripting language for Windows.

## Installation

To use this script, you need to have [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed on your computer. Then, download or clone this repository and run the `brightness.ahk` file.

In the future, there will be a packaged version available as an `.exe` file for easier installation.

## Usage

You can use the following keyboard shortcuts to control the brightness of your screen:

- `Ctrl + Alt + Up`: Increase brightness by 10%
- `Ctrl + Alt + Down`: Decrease brightness by 10%
- `Ctrl + Alt + Home`: Set brightness to 100%
- `Ctrl + Alt + End`: Set brightness to 0%

You can also customize the hotkeys and the brightness levels by editing the script.

There will also be a version available for Samsung notebook keyboards (and possibly compatible with other brands) that maps the original brightness control keys.

## Updates

This script is basic and will likely receive few or no updates in the future.
